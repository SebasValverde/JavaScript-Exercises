# JavaScript Exercises

Welcome to my JavaScript Exercises Portfolio! This project was created with the goal of **practicing and demonstrating my front-end development skills**, especially in **JavaScript**, through a series of interactive and visually cohesive exercises grouped by difficulty.

These exercises cover essential programming concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, timers, arrays, and dynamic UI updates. Each one was developed with **Bootstrap** for styling and structured following clean HTML, CSS, and JS practices.

## ðŸŽ¥ Project Demo

Here you can see a video showcasing how the project works:

> ðŸ“Œ **[Insert link to video here â€” YouTube, Loom, Drive, etc.]**

This video includes:
- A walkthrough of the index page
- A demonstration of each exercise in action
- Explanations of how the code behaves dynamically

##  Project Structure

Each exercise is contained within its own HTML file and follows a consistent design structure. The code is organized into:

- `/html` â†’ Individual exercise pages  
- `/Js` â†’ JavaScript logic files  
- `/css` â†’ Shared styling (`stylespages.css`)
- `Index.html` â†’ Home navigation

##  Exercises Overview

###  Easy Exercises

####  1. Generate a Random Number
Generates a random number between 1 and 100 when a button is clicked. Demonstrates basic randomization and output handling.

####  2. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
Converts a temperature entered in Celsius to Fahrenheit using a standard conversion formula.

####  3. Click Counter
Each time a button is clicked, a counter increases and updates on the screen. Great for practicing state management in JS.

####  4. Check if a Number is Even or Odd
User enters a number, and the app tells them whether itâ€™s even or odd using the modulo operator.

####  5. Display Current Date and Time
Shows the current date and updates the time in real-time using `setInterval` and `Date` object.

###  Intermediate Exercises

####  6. Reverse a String
Takes user input and displays it reversed. This exercise covers string manipulation and loop logic.

####  7. Add Two Numbers Entered by the User
Two number fields are added together on button click, showcasing type conversion and user interaction.

####  8. Check if a Word is a Palindrome
Determines if a word reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring case. Useful for logic practice.

####  9. Count Characters in an Input Field
Real-time character counter that updates as the user types. Demonstrates use of `input` events and dynamic updates.

####  10. Change Background Color Randomly
Changes the background color of the page to a random hex value each time a button is clicked.

---

###  Hard Exercises

####  11. Countdown Timer
Counts down from a number entered by the user to 0 with one-second intervals using `setInterval`.

####  12. Random Password Generator
Generates a strong password based on user preferences (length, symbols, numbers). Shows string generation and checkbox handling.

####  13. To-Do List
Allows users to add and delete tasks interactively. Covers `createElement`, `appendChild`, and `remove()` methods.

####  14. Filter Items in a List
As the user types in an input field, a list is filtered live to match entries. Useful for real-time search logic.

####  15. Dice Roll Simulation
Simulates rolling two dice by generating two numbers from 1 to 6. Optionally displays images of dice faces.
